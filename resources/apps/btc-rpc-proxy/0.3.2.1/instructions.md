# Usage Instructions

## Dependencies

Bitcoin Proxy requires a Bitcoin node to function. By default, Bitcoin Proxy will connect to the Bitcoin Core node running on your Embassy.

## Config

You must create at least one user to your Bitcoin Proxy config. Each user you create will receive their own RPC username and password, which can be used for remote access. This is also where you can edit RPC credentials.

## Properties

This section includes a convenient list of copyable properties, such as the quick connect URLs and RPC username and passwords for each configured user.

## Using a Wallet

Enter your user's QuickConnect QR code **OR** your raw user credentials (both located in `properties`) into any wallet that supports connecting to a remote node over Tor.

    long: Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. Bitcoin
      uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;
      managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively
      by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or
      controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties,
      Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment
      system.
